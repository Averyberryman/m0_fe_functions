# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

- I a most proud of collaborating with a classmate effectively to make sure we both grasped the concept. This took me a very very long time to do and I think that as we worked more together it got easier as time went on. I did not expect this to take me as long as it did and having another voice to look at it with me helped me break out of my narrow concept of why it wasn't working and try different options.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

- functions allow us to avoid having to rewrite lengthy blocks of code by storing a method to be used repeatedly. This means we can just manipulate variables on a case by case basis instead of writing out full lines of code every time we need to, for example, check the stock of an item.
